# Unix Clone

This project is a simple Unix-like command line interface implemented in Python. It mimics basic Unix commands such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`.

## Features

```
        'ls': list_files,
        'cp': copy_file,
        'mv': move_file,
        'rm': remove_file,
        'touch': touch_file,
        'pwd': print_working_directory,
        'cd': change_directory,
        'cat': cat_file,
        'mkdir': make_directory,
        'echo': echo,
        'help': show_help
```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the Unix clone application, run:

```
python src/main.py
```

Once the application is running, you can enter commands similar to those in a Unix shell. 

## Commands

- `ls`: Lists all files in the current directory.
- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copies a file from the source path to the destination path.
- `mv <source> <destination>`: Moves a file from the source path to the destination path.
- `rm <file>`: Deletes the specified file.
